I am developing the skills to develop websites and that starts with an understanding of html. 
This project will engage all of the knowledge I have thus far acquired regarding html to include:Generating an index page generated a and linked to a secondary page, generate organized and unorganized lists, generating clickable links, adding images to page, and resized images.
