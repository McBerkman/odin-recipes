This is a basic html page that links to recipes.

I am developing the skills to develop websites and that starts with an understanding of html. 
This project will engage all of the knowledge I have thus far acquired regarding html to include:Generating an index page generated a and linked to a secondary page, generate organized and unorganized lists, generating clickable links, adding images to page, and resized images.

*UPDATE* This is a circle back as I have been learning how to style with css.
*UPDATE 11.28** Updating page with box model knowledge
