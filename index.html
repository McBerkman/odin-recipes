            <h3>Tuscan Soup</h3>
                <p class="rich">This is a tasty Tuscan Soup recipe that you will love trying. Use a spicy sausage to really elevate this dish.</p>
                <p class="poor">Ingredients</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 lb hot Italian sausage</li>
                        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                        <li>1 Medium white onion</li>
                        <li>1.5 lb gold potatoes, diced</li>
                        <li>5 cups chicken bone broth</li>
                        <li>2 cup fresh kale, chopped</li>
                        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                        <li>6 pieces of bacon</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook sausage in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, breaking the sausage into small pieces as it cooks. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked sausage to a separate plate, reserving 1 tablespoon grease in the stockpot for later*, and discarding the excess grease.  (I actually like to briefly rinse my cooked sausage in a strainer to remove even more excess grease.)  Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Add onions to the stockpot (with the grease), and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add garlic, and sauté for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.  Add the potatoes, chicken stock, and cooked sausage, and continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.  Stir in the kale and cream, and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Serve warm and garnish with bacon.</li>
                        <p></p>

            <h3>Potato Leek Soup</h3>
                <p class="rich">You won't believe this Potato Soup recipe.</p>
                <p class="poor">Ingredients</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 tablespoon butter</li>
                        <li>4 large leeks</li>
                        <li>3 cloves garlic peeled and smashed</li>
                        <li>2 lb gold potatoes</li>
                        <li>7 cups chicken bone broth</li>
                        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                        <li>3 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
                        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>chives, finely chopped</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so as not to brown.</li>
                        <li>Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are very soft.</li>
                        <li>Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée the soup in batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If soup is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it's too thick, add water or stock to thin it out. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.</li>
                        <p></p>

            <h3>Carrot Ginger Soup</h3>
                <p class="rich">If you haven't learned yet, it is in fact soup season. The soups are out. This carrot soup is sooth and delicious. It can be served cold or hot (I like it hot)</p>
                <p class="poor">Ingredients</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
                        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup, optional</li>
                        <li>Coconut milk, for garnish, optional</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, salt and pepper and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add the smashed garlic cloves (they’ll get blended later) and carrots to the pot and cook 8 minutes more, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the ginger, apple cider vinegar, and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Let cool slightly and transfer to a blender. Blend until smooth. If your soup is too thick, add a little water. If you would like your soup a little sweeter, add the maple syrup. Serve.</li>

            <h3>Crispy Skin Chicken Thigh</h3>
                <p class="rich">This is the first deviation from the soups. This is a good old fashioned crispy skin chicken thigh. Add heat to your herbs and seasonings. Serve it with some fresh produce and a starch. This dinner is simple and delicious.</p> 
                <p class="poor">Ingredients</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skin on chicken leg and thighs</li>
                        <li>2 tbl EVOO</li>
                        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 tsp paprika</li>
                        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Remove the chicken thighs from the fridge and allow them to come to room temperature. Pat dry with a paper towel to remove any moisture. Then, In a small bowl, mix all of the herbs and spices together.</li>
                        <li>Place the chicken in a large mixing bowl. Add the oil and ⅔ of the spice blend. Use your hands to coat all sides of the chicken, and even get it under the skin.</li>
                        <li>Place the chicken on a rack on top of a baking sheet. Sprinkle the remaining spice mix on top of the chicken.</li>
                        <li>Bake the chicken thighs for 35 to 40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 170°F. You can also turn on the top broiler for 2 to 3 minutes to make the top extra crispy. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
